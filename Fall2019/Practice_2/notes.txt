A.) Paint the numbers
paint each number and each number can share a color if they have the same lcd
sort and use a sieve

B.) Koala and Lights
max num of lights on at the same time
simulate each light (n=100)
- 1000 times *look at time constraints

C.) Paint the digits
??

D.) Cow & Snacks
min # of cows who don't get a snack, and each cow has 2 favorite snacks 
each snack is a vertex
each edge is a cow
# of sad cows = # of cycles (repeated vertices) = V - E + C

Balloons
greedy
sort by abs value of (dA-dB)
makes sense since it takes care of when a team needs to take from both A & B
taking the abs value will minimize the penalty of taking from the wrong team 
since we want to take more from room A if we're closer to Team A and the same
if the team is closer to for room B

It's Magic
binary representation
using a bit mask
