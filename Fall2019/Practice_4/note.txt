Abstract Art
1. Make the art a bipartite graph
r - G - r
|   |   |
G - r - G

2. You can make a node an edge by splitting it into an in and out node
u = edge(u_in,u_out)

3. Make the bipartite graph a flow graph

Vertex Cover: A set of verticies such that edge vertex has at least one edge
Konig's theorem: the maximum number of matched edges, is the minimum number of edges in the graph's vertex cover
Alternating path: Going from a match to unmatched edge, matched to unmatched and so on
