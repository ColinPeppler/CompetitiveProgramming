ProblemA: Chicken McNuggets
- Checking all possible linear combinations of ax + by + cz = n
- Brute force using 3 for loops

ProblemB: Grandmother's Jam
- Simulate an order of washing (3mins), filling (2mins) and closing (1min)
- I ran into two edge cases (both b.c they are small # where there is overlap)
	a. n = 8
	b. n = 9
- could've checked first 10 cases

ProblemC: Chicken McNuggets Hard
- acting similar to a sieve
- Frobenius number is the largest number for b
	s. t. ax + by + ... + cz = b has NO SOLUTION	



Math Gone Viral
- using a Stack
- expression tree
- recursive descent parser

Bab's Bob Boutique
- track state using bitmask dp
- or just using backtracking since n <= 10
