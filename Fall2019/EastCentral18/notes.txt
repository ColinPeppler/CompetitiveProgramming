Problem J: Watch Where You Step (Strongly Connected Components)
- each zone is a strongly connected component
- a component where each element is connected
- all strongly connected components form a linear chain
* use SCC class in handbook

1.) Find strongly connected components using Tarjans in O(n)
2.) Find the number of nodes within each strongly connected component
3.) Then calculate with
	insight: if strongly connected component A is connected to strongly
	connected component B then all nodes in A can connect to nodes in B


Problem G: Roman Holiday (
Insight: The Roman numerals repeat in blocks 0-38
Use Int->Roman using a dict


Problem I: Tour De Sales Force (TSP)
Context: given 50 graphs, each having 3-8 nodes
(a) find total length of the tour, assuming shortest length
(b) find optimal way to sort tours into 25 merged pairs with an overal
shortest tour length
- time complexity = O(2^n * n^2)
	- 2^n for each possible subset

B(S,w) = min over all v in S\{w} [B(S/{w},v) + cost(u,w))]

finding optimal matching = max weight matching in a bipartite graph
hungarian + mincost


Problem Sequential Yahtzee (DP)
base case: if index + 5 > N
calculation: calculate the maximum value
DP[i][j] = DP[i+1][j+1] + max(i)
