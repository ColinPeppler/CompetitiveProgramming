Problem C: Substring Switcheroo 
- try every possible substring
- store char frequency in a histogram <char, int>
- store histograms in a map <<char, int>, int>
	- Java would use an arraylist as list<int>
- for the other string
	- try every possible substring
	- store char frequency in a histogram
	- then check if histogram was made in other substring
