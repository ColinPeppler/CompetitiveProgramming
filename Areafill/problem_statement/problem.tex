Microsoft Paint offers a fill tool which fills an enclosed area on the screen with color. For this question you'll be replicating a simpler version! A 2D array is given with only two characters
'X' and 'O'. The 'X' represents a filled in spaced, and the 'O' represents an empty space. In addition, a coordinate will be given (x,y). You will print a 2D array as if you used the fill tool
at the coordinate given on the matrix. Good luck!

Input
n m
2D Array
x y

n - number of rows, 1 <= n <= 100
m - number of columns, 1 <= m <= 100
2D Array - a 2D Array consisting of X and O
x - target row, 0 <= x <= 99
y - target col, 0 <= y <= 99

Example:

Input
3 5
XXOXX
XOOOX
XXOXX
0 2

Output
XXXXX
XXXXX
XXXXX
