To cluster -> maximize minimal distance across groups
- MST with only 2 clusters

Instead do binary search to minimize max distance across groups
can be modeled with bicoloring/ checking for bipartitness
can also use 2-SAT

Min Flow
Source node connects to all A nodes
Sink node connects too all B nodes

Node splitting
- in nodes
- out nodes

    -c-      -> in - c - out ->

Dice used DP so u dont have to recalculate probabilities
